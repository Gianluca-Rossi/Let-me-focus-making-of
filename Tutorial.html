		<div>Once upon a time...
Every day a boy 👨🏽‍💻 wakes up and goes to the library 📚 to focus on his projects, some days though, it's very hard to do so, everything seems to distract him. 😫
 
Today in the jungle, I mean, the library, hidden between the bookshelfs there are his worst concentration saboteurs: the ringing smartphones.
 
 There is only one way to focus today, he needs to mute 'em all! 🔕
 


 
 How to play

 






 🏃‍♂️ Drag the left side of the screen to walk
 
 





 





 🎥 Drag the right side to move the camera

		<div>😡 What the heck? these smartphones are going crazy!! Find the ringing phone and mute it, someone must be messing with them, cause they fire one after the other!
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>🐶 Your spiteful dog is running under the tables, catching him won't be easy, he'll try to run away from you!
